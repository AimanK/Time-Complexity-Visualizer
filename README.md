# Time-Complexity-Visualizer
An algorithmic time complexity data visualization tool, for coders by coders

# Algorithm Visualizer: System Design & Starting Point
High-Level Architecture
Frontend:

# Technologies: TypeScript, React, D3.js
Responsibilities: User interface, algorithm visualization, step-by-step execution, customizable input data.
Backend:

Technologies: Node.js
Responsibilities: Handle algorithm logic, process requests from the frontend, manage data storage if needed.
Data Flow:

User Interaction: Users interact with the frontend to select algorithms and input data.
Request Processing: The frontend sends requests to the backend to run selected algorithms.
Algorithm Execution: The backend executes the algorithms and sends the results/steps back to the frontend.
Visualization: The frontend uses D3.js to create visualizations based on the backend data.
Detailed Component Design
Frontend:

# React Components:

AlgorithmSelector: Dropdown to select the algorithm (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort, Dijkstra, A).
InputDataForm: Form to input custom data.
Visualizer: Component to display the algorithm's visualization using D3.js.
StepControls: Controls to step through the algorithm execution.
ExplanationPane: Pane to show step-by-step explanations.
D3.js Visualization:

# Sorting Algorithms Visualization: Bars or nodes to represent elements, with animations to show sorting steps.
# Graph Algorithms Visualization: Nodes and edges to represent graphs, with animations to show pathfinding or traversal.
Backend:

# API Endpoints (Node.js):

/executeAlgorithm: Endpoint to receive algorithm type and input data, then execute the algorithm and return steps.
/getAlgorithmInfo: Endpoint to retrieve information about the algorithm (e.g., time complexity, steps).
Algorithm Implementations:

Sorting Algorithms: Implement QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.
Graph Algorithms: Implement Dijkstra, A, BFS, DFS.
Pathfinding Algorithms: Implement A, BFS, DFS.
Starting Point Approach
Step 1: Initial Setup

# Frontend:

Set up a new React project with TypeScript.
Install and configure D3.js for visualizations.
Backend:

Set up a new Node.js project.
Install necessary dependencies (Express.js for API, algorithms library if available).
Step 2: Basic UI and API

# Frontend:

Create basic UI components (AlgorithmSelector, InputDataForm, Visualizer).
Implement a simple layout with placeholders.
Backend:

Create basic API endpoints.
Implement a simple algorithm (e.g., BubbleSort) and return mock data.
Step 3: Visualization Implementation

Frontend:
Implement the visualizer component using D3.js.
Create a simple bar chart for sorting algorithms.
Implement animations for sorting steps.
Step 4: Algorithm Execution Logic

Backend:
Implement sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort).
Ensure the backend sends step-by-step data to the frontend.
Step 5: Integration and Interaction

# Frontend:
Integrate the frontend with the backend.
Implement step-by-step controls and visual updates.
Add an explanation pane for step-by-step explanations.
Step 6: Graph and Pathfinding Algorithms

# Backend:

Implement graph algorithms (Dijkstra, A).
Implement pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS).
Frontend:

Create visualizations for graph algorithms (nodes and edges).
Implement animations for traversal and pathfinding steps.
Future Enhancements
Customization: Allow users to customize visualization styles and parameters.
